    <p>I always liked eletronics and computers since my young age.<br />
Started taking apart VHS player/recorder and small stereo at around 7-8 years old for learning and/or repairs.</p>

<p>When i was 12 in 1999 we got our first computer, i was always ahead of everybody, Teachers were taking me from the classroom to debug the school computer or help them install programs.</p>

<p>in 2004 when i was 15, i got into a car crash, and it was really bad.<br />
I spent a lot of time home afterward, gaming and making web server, website, gaming server. I learned html and then php, mysql. I was also Heavily into electronics, circuit and PCB design.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017-2018 when i was about 28-29, i got sicker because of my meniere disease and back problems.<br />
I got alot more into programming, i started with arduino to learn c, c++.<br />
I made a few projects and a freelance colab with someone else, a digital 3 phase LFO with frequency and depth controls. Then i wanted to make a windows app (the system monitor on my website) so i learned c#.</p>

<p>I started making my personal website and learned CSS and javascript(AJAX, jquery, even tho i dont use it on my site.).</p>

<p>So there i am, if i can help in any way, contact me, am looking for freelance programming/electronic jobs to add to my portfolio and make a living.</p>

<p>Also since am living with a disability and if you appreciate my work, any support is really welcome.</p>
